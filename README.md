# Mendix Userlib Cleaner

This little utility can be used to identify and clean duplicate JARs. It was created mainly for [Mendix](https://mendix.com) apps due to lack of formal dependency management support. This is by no means limited to Mendix use-case. It works for arbitary systems.

Please note that this is not a magic tool that solves all JAR problems. After running the clean tool, always clean your project, rebuild and run it locally.

## In rush?

- Download the windows build from [release](https://github.com/cinaq/mendix-userlib-cleaner/releases)
- Unzip the `mendix-userlib-cleaner.exe` into your userlib you want to clean
- In Explorer window location write `cmd` and press enter. This opens a black terminal window
- In this terminal window write: `.\mendix-userlib-cleaner.exe`
- It should inform you what it will remove. Verify the output and to actually remove the jars write: `.\mendix-userlib-cleaner.exe --clean`

## Why clean userlib?

Most Mendix modules include one or more JAR files. JAR files are java libraries. This is a common approach to extend functionalities in Mendix apps. However as your application ages and grows there's a need to add more modules or update existing ones which introduces newer versions. These JAR's are not managed by Mendix Studio. Due to these dynamics, newer JAR can be introduced at later stage. This causes duplication. Due to JAR duplication it often causes compatibility issues. If you are lucky these errors occur during compile time. At other times these occur during runtime.

## How does this work?

It works as follow:

- list all the JAR files
- for each JAR file compute its properties by extracting `MANIFEST.MF` or `pom.properties` from the JAR file
- Next we loop over the metadata and determine which JAR to keep and discard duplicates. This is done based on the package name (e.g. org.package.velocity) and the version (e.g. 1.7)
- Those marked to be discarded are then removed.

Note that `mode` now also accepts path to `m2ee-log.txt`. This file can be obtained when you run your app locally in **Mendix Studio Pro**.

## Usage

```bash
mendix-userlib-cleaner --help
Usage of mendix-userlib-cleaner:
      --clean           Turn on to actually remove the duplicate JARs.
      --mode string     Jar parsing mode. Supported options: auto, strict or path to m2ee-log.txt (default "auto")
      --target string   Path to userlib. (default ".")

### File name parsing

When no usable metadata is found in the manifest or POM files, we try to parse the filename itself to determine the package name and version. For example:

```
eventTrackingLibrary-1.0.2.jar -> local.eventtracking
```

And version would be `1.0.2`.


### Optimistic parsing

Sometimes there is no usable metadata included in the package. In that case we try to compose the package name by finding the first class file in the jar of which resides in the directory `org` or `com`. e.g. `org.junit`
